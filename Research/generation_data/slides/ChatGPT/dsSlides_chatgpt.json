        "title": "What is a Graph?",
        "content": "Definition: A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Types of Graphs: Directed (edges have direction) vs. Undirected (edges have no direction). Weighted vs. Unweighted: Edges in weighted graphs have associated costs or values."

        "title": "Representing Graphs in Data Structures",
        "content": "Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where matrix[i][j] indicates the edge between i and j. Ideal for dense graphs. Adjacency List: An array of lists, where each list represents a node and its connected nodes. Efficient for sparse graphs. Edge List: A list of all edges, represented as pairs (or triples if weighted). Simple and direct."

        "title": "Paths and Cycles in Graphs",
        "content": "Path: A sequence of edges connecting two vertices. Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex. Hamiltonian Path: Passes through each vertex exactly once. Eulerian Path: Uses every edge of the graph exactly once."

        "title": "Connectivity in Graphs",
        "content": "Connected Graph: There is a path between every pair of vertices. Strongly Connected Graph (Directed): Every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. Components: Subgraphs in which any two vertices are connected to each other, and not connected to any other vertices outside the subgraph."
