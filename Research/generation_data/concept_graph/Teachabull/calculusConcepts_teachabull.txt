{"name": "Derivatives in Calculus",
"definition": "In calculus, Derivatives are used to measure how a function's value changes as its input changes. The Definition of a Derivative is the limit of the difference quotient as the interval approaches zero, which provides an exact rate of change at any given point. Understanding the Interpretation of the Derivative is crucial, as it can represent velocity, slope, or rate of change in various contexts. Students must learn Differentiation Formulas , including the Product Rule and Quotient Rule , which are methods for finding the derivatives of functions involving multiplication and division, respectively. The Chain Rule is another fundamental technique for differentiating composite functions. Implicit Differentiation is used when a function is not explicitly solved for one variable in terms of another, and Related Rates problems involve finding a rate at which one quantity changes by relating it to another changing quantity. Students will also explore Higher Order Derivatives , which are derivatives of a function taken multiple times, and Logarithmic Differentiation , which simplifies the process of differentiating functions by using logarithms. Specialized derivative formulas for Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions , Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithm Functions , and Derivatives of Hyperbolic Functions are also part of the curriculum.",
