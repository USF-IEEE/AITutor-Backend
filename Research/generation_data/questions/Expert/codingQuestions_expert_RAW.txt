Coding questions
Implement an ELIZA-like program, using substitutions. Keep in mind that you would need a domain in which your program can legitimately engage in a lot of simple repetition.

Compute the edit distance (using insertion cost 1, deletion cost 1, substitution cost 1) of “leda” to “deal”. Show your work (using the edit distance grid).

Conceptual questions: 
Write regular expressions for the following languages. By “word”, we mean an alphabetic string separated from other words by whitespace, any relevant
punctuation, line breaks, and so forth.

1. the set of all strings with two consecutive repeated words (e.g., “Humbert Humbert” and “the the” but not “the bug” or “the big bug”);
2. all strings that start at the beginning of the line with an integer and that end at the end of the line with a word;
