a) [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}
b) [A-Za-z]+@[A-Za-z]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}
c) [A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z]+\.[A-Za-z]
d) [@]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}

In text normalization, what does the process of stemming primarily aim to achieve?
a) Converting all text to lowercase.
b) Removing prefixes and suffixes from a word.
c) Translating text into another language.
d) Identifying the root meaning of a sentence.

Coding Questions
Write a Python function that uses regular expressions to check if a given string is a valid date in the format dd-mm-yyyy.

Implement a Python function that uses regular expressions to extract all the hashtags (e.g., #example) from a given string representing a social media post.

Conceptual Questions
How does edit distance contribute to improving the performance of a spell checker in natural language processing?

Discuss the main differences and use-cases for lemmatization vs. stemming in the context of text normalization.



SECOND TEST

Multiple Choice Questions
Which of the following regular expressions correctly matches any string of one or more lowercase letters followed by the letter 'b'?
A) [a-z]*b
B) [a-z]+b
C) b[a-z]+
D) [b-z]*

In the context of text normalization, which of the following best describes the process of stemming?
A) Separating punctuation from words
B) Converting all characters to lowercase
C) Finding the root form of a word by removing affixes
D) Splitting text into individual sentences

Coding Questions
Write a Python function using regular expressions to check if a given string is a valid email address.

Implement a basic function in Python to calculate the edit distance between two strings. You may assume equal cost for insertions, deletions, and substitutions.

Conceptual Questions
Explain how regular expressions can be used for sentence segmentation and the challenges that might arise with this approach.

Discuss the difference between lemmatization and stemming, providing examples of when each might be more appropriate in NLP tasks.



THIRD TEST

Multiple Choice Questions
What does the Kleene Star in a regular expression represent?
A) Match the preceding character one or more times.
B) Match the preceding character zero or more times.
C) Match any single character except newline.
D) Match the beginning of a line.

Which of the following is a primary application of edit distance in NLP?
A) Word tokenization.
B) Sentence segmentation.
C) Spelling correction.
D) Part-of-speech tagging.

Coding Questions
Write a Python function `normalize_text(text)` that takes a string `text` and returns the text after replacing all occurrences of 'U.S.A.' with 'USA' and splitting it into a list of words. Use regular expressions.
Example:
   ```python
   normalize_text("I visited the U.S.A. last year.") 
   # Should return ['I', 'visited', 'the', 'USA', 'last', 'year.']
   ```

Implement a Python function `simple_edit_distance(str1, str2)` that calculates the edit distance between two strings `str1` and `str2` using only insertions and deletions, each having a cost of 1.
Example:
   ```python
   simple_edit_distance("kitten", "sitting") 
   # Should return 3
   ```

Conceptual Questions
Explain how tokenization can be more complex in languages without clear word boundaries, such as Japanese, compared to languages like English.**

Describe the difference between stemming and lemmatization in text normalization. Why might one be preferred over the other in certain NLP tasks?**
