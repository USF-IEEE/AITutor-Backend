Create a Concept Graph, i.e. Concepts and their sub Concepts, which fully covers Artificial Intelligence from a Computer Science context. Output the generic list format and then convert the output into the following plaintext format separated by new lines and tabs:

1. Concept A
   - Concept B
       - concept c

2. Concept D
...

```plaintext
concept a
\tconcept b
\t\tconcept c
concept d
...
```

Note: It is important to include as much academic detail as possible since the graph you create will be used to teach a student the topic.
